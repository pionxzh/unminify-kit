# Terser

This is the tracking list of support status of the reversion of [compressor options](https://github.com/terser/terser#compress-options) in Terser.

- ~~Strike through~~ means the option is invalid, or not possible to be reversed, or out of the scope of this project.
- The question mark `?` means the viability of the option is not being thoroughly considered.
- We will replicate the behavior of some rules in Terser as they do a great job on readability improvement.

---

- [ ] arguments
  - TODO: priority `low`.
  - We can do the same thing this rule does as some obfuscator might use arguments to obfuscate.
- [X] arrows
  - `lebab`'s `arrow` rule.
- [X] ~~booleans_as_integers~~
  - `a === true` will be converted to `a == 1`.
  - It is risky to reverse a loose equality.
- [X] booleans
  - `un-boolean`
- [X] ~~collapse_vars~~: Lossy compression. No valuable pattern to be reversed.
- [ ] comparisons
- [ ] computed_props
  - TODO:
- [X] conditionals
  - `un-conditionals`
- [X] ~~dead_code~~
- [X] ~~defaults~~
- [X] ~~directives~~
- [X] ~~drop_console~~
- [X] ~~drop_debugger~~
- [X] ~~ecma~~
- [X] ~~evaluate~~: Lossy compression.
- [X] ~~expression~~
- [X] ~~global_defs~~
- [X] ~~hoist_funs~~
- [X] ~~hoist_props~~: Lossy compression.
- [X] ~~hoist_vars~~
- [X] ~~ie8~~
- [X] if_return
  - `un-conditionals`
- [X] ~~inline~~
- [X] join_vars
  - `un-variable-merging`
- [X] ~~keep_classnames~~
- [X] ~~keep_fargs~~
- [X] ~~keep_fnames~~
- [X] keep_infinity
- [ ] loops
  - TODO: priority `high`. We already covered part of the cases.
  - `un-while-loop`.
- [X] ~~module~~
- [X] ~~negate_iife~~: No readability improvement.
- [X] ~~passes~~
- [X] properties
  - `un-bracket-notation`
- [X] ~~pure_funcs~~
- [X] ~~pure_getters~~
- [X] ~~reduce_funcs~~
- [X] ~~reduce_vars~~: Lossy compression.
- [X] sequences
  - `un-sequence-expression`
- [X] ~~side_effects~~
- [X] ~~switches~~: Lossy compression.
- [X] ~~top_retain~~
- [X] ~~toplevel~~
- [X] ~~typeofs~~: No readability improvement.
- [X] ~~unsafe~~
  - It did a great job on readability improvement. And we don't need to reverse it.
- [ ] unsafe_arrows
  - See `arrows`.
- [X] ~~unsafe_comps~~: Lossy compression.
- [X] ~~unsafe_Function~~
- [X] ~~unsafe_math~~: Lossy compression.
- [X] ~~unsafe_symbols~~: Lossy compression.
- [X] ~~unsafe_methods~~: No readability improvement.
- [X] unsafe_proto
  - `un-builtin-prototype`
- [X] ~~unsafe_regexp~~
- [X] unsafe_undefined:
  - `un-undefined`
- [X] ~~unused~~
